    "# Heat Transfer in Ice\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain experience with some solutions to this heat equation, we have prepared a Python notebook. The idea is to allow you to vary input parameters for a few scenarios and learn to better anticipate what the results might be. It is not important that you have a background in coding with python. Rather, the intent here is that you adjust inputs to the functions and think about the results.\n",

    "- We have provided helper notes on locations where we think that you should change the code to play around with one of the models (### Please Change! ###) as well as notes in places where you probably shouldn't change the code (### Don't Change ###). Having said that, if you are familiar with python feel free to change whatever you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code can be run with the buttons at the top or from the keyboard. Press 'Shift+Enter' to run a cell and advance to the next cell or 'Ctrl+Enter' to run a cell and stay in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The figures are interactive. Try the sliders, zooming, panning, or rescaling the figure to get a better look at function output."

A real-world example would be if the Earth's climate changed and air temperatures increased. Heat will begin to diffuse into the domain and warm up the ice below the surface.\n",
